## peak-base.css

Base style fo the Peak Besign System - includes only basic elemental styling and themes, no layout or structure patterns

## Usage


## Option 1 - SCSS
A `theme` file is required to be `@import`-ed prior to `peak-base.css`. The theme file will pre-load all required vaiables for the Peak base styling:

**example:**

```
@import '~@wealthbar/peak-base.css/scss/theme/wealthbar';
@import '~@wealthbar/peak-base.css/scss/index';
```

Additionally, `theme` files can be loaded on a per component/page basis to allow use of colour and setting variables within the templated file. Ideally this should be handled by webpack so the developers aren't bothered with having to import a theme everytime they choose to use a variable in the template. The biggest advantage of the webpack setup is the ability to switch theme based on build config ENV variables.

**example webpack setup:**

```
const theme = JSON.parse(configEnv.WHITELABEL_BRAND);

â€¦

loader: 'sass-loader',
  options: {
    data: `@import "~@wealthbar/peak-base.css/theme/${theme}.scss";`,
    includePaths: ['src/styles'],
  },
```
## Option 2 - CSS

CSS files are compiled based on theme and package requirements they can be directly imported into any html file. Since CSS is pre-compiled no theme file needs to be added, as a result there is access to SCSS variables outside the scope of the file.

base - minimal css  (reset, basic elements, typography, minimal button and input styling)
patterns - common css patterns applied via classes (button and input style options)


**example:**
```
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="wealthbar-base.css" media="screen" />>
</head>
```
